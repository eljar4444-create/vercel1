# GSD

## Purpose

The Antigravity GSD (Get Stuff Done) skill implements a rigid, spec-driven hierarchy for managing software development tasks. It enforces a separation of concerns between Planning, Execution, and Verification phases to reduce context switching and improve reliability.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
1.  **Starting a Project**: Initializing a new codebase or feature set with a clear structure.
2.  **Planning Work**: Breaking down vague requirements into actionable, verified specifications.
3.  **Executing Tasks**: Implementing code based on approved specs without context switching.
4.  **Managing State**: Tracking progress through defined phases (Plan -> Execute -> Verify).

**Triggers:**

## System Overview

### 1. Phase-Based Development
The system enforces distinct phases. You typically cannot execute until you have planned.
- **Plan**: Define specs, tasks, and acceptance criteria. Output is a plan artifact.
- **Execute**: Write code to satisfy the specs. Driven by the plan artifact.
- **Verify**: Confirm the code meets criteria.

### 2. Available Commands
The following slash commands are available in this skill. Use them to drive the GSD process:

### 3. Directory Structure
The skill uses a standardized directory structure for portability and organization:
- `references/commands/`: Executable slash command definitions.
- `references/agents/`: Specialized agent prompts and personas used by the commands.
- `references/workflows/`: Step-by-step standard operating procedures and guidelines.
- `references/docs/`: Contextual documentation and guides on the GSD philosophy.
- `assets/templates/`: Reusable file structures for plans, tasks, and reports.

## Reference Files

For detailed instructions, consult the following resources:

### [Commands Reference](references/commands/)
List of all available slash commands and their detailed arguments. Look here to understand how to invoke specific GSD actions.

### [Workflow Guides](references/workflows/)
Standard procedures for common development tasks. These documents describe the "how-to" for the GSD process.

### [Agent Definitions](references/agents/)
Capabilities and personas of the specialized agents. Useful for understanding who does what in the multi-agent setup.

### [Documentation](references/docs/)
General documentation on the GSD philosophy, usage patterns, and configuration.

## Best Practices

1.  **Follow the Sequence**: Do not skip the Planning phase. A good plan saves hours of debugging.
2.  **Use Templates**: Leverage `assets/templates/` for consistent file structures.
3.  **Update State**: Keep the project state synchronized using `/gsd:progress`.
4.  **One Context**: Keep separate contexts (channels/threads) for Planning vs Execution to avoid contamination.
5.  **CLI Invocation**: `gsd-tools` is **NOT** a global command. Always invoke it with the full node path: `node .agent/skills/gsd/bin/gsd-tools.cjs <command> [args]`. Never run `gsd-tools` bare.
